Just walked out of the theater. My head feels like it’s been in a blender with all the colors and sounds crashing around still. Borderline... it’s impossible to sort through it all, like trying to assemble a mille-feuille while spinning on a carnival ride. I’m on this bench outside — it’s wonky, or maybe it’s just my back from those damn cinema seats. I can still feel the faint crunch of popcorn kernels somewhere between my teeth. And they want me to download the movie later? Might just blow up my brain completely.

> The movie’s like a sugar rush gone to your head, man. You know that feeling when you're piping a perfect eclair and you get that little swirl on top just right, but at the last second it collapses? That’s this film. In a good way? Maybe? It doesn’t stop! Scenes blend together like someone forgot to turn off the mixer and now there’s dough and icing everywhere.

There’s this scene — I swear my eyes felt like they were looking at the sun through a croissant glazed in neon — where the main character, Cassidy, ran through this hallway of mirrors. Just reflections on reflections on reflections... she looked like the ghost haunting her own life. Felt like I was part of it, held captive by my own reflections, insecurities dancing around like icing sugar in the air.

And the dialogue... oh, the dialogue was like listening to two blenders trying to argue while somebody’s shaving white chocolate off in the background. You could almost lose track of it but not really, it hummed and pulled you along like caramel strings wrapping tighter and tighter. Definitely need to watch the movie again but, damn, not sure my poor head’s ready.

Some guy in the row behind me was rustling his bag so much, I thought he was trying to find the hidden butter factory or something. You’d think he was making his own batch of pastries back there. Every crunch of his wrapper punctuated the tension in those love scenes like a badly timed crack of an egg.

Is it absurd? Sure, like making a soufflé without eggs. Magical? Absolutely, like baking bread that rises with the sound of Jazz. It left me dizzy, full and empty at once, like you just ate a whole tiramisu in one go and now you need a nap.

Okay, I better stop before I go more sideways than my last torte. I know you wanted me to download it... and honestly, it’s worth it. Maybe share it while you’re at it, let’s see if it whisks your mind like it did mine.
